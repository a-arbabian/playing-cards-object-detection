### Results
I ran YOLOv3 on my own generated dataset of 60,000 images. 
Results:
| mAP | IoU | F1-Score |
| :--- |:---| :---|
| 99.86% | 82.92% |  0.99 |

### Limitations
* Only tested on Bicycle cards. I chose this deck due to its popularity in commercial use.

### Todo
- [ ] Update to use a PyTorch version of YOLO
- [ ] Upload dataset to Kaggle
